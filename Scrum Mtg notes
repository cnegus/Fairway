Scrum Notes:
  -scrum: one of the best agile development processes used today
-Feature requests/ User story
  Scrum- requests written in terms of end user
    "As a ________, I want _____ so that _________"
    (re product)
    
-Collection of all user stories known as PRODUCT BACKLOG
  -pretty much a wishlist that would make product great
-Plan which user stories go in release

-Product Owner: makes sure features are prioritized
Scrum Master: Proect manager
  -sets up meetings
  -overlooks work being done
  -makes sure the project is going smoothly
Includes developers, testers, customers, executives

Release planning starts with product backlog
  release backlog contains which user stories you want to put into release
    then user stories are prioritized and estimated

ESTIMATES:
-in hours (1,2,4,8 hours)
-in days (2,3,5,10 days )
-in months (1,2,3,6 mos) (should be broken down into days)

Sprints are short duration milestones that allow the team to get a few user stories done and ship-ready

-Late sprint finishes show that the project is not on schedule
-its important to moniter sprints with burndown charts
-Burndown chart provides daily measure of work left in release
-Slope of graph is burndown velocity---gives you estimate of finish release date
-you can also use it to project a completion date for what needs to ahppen
-knowing if you're on time allows you to make adjustments early on
-to get info for burndown chart, each team member logs their progress on the sprint backlog
-burndown displays that visually

Daily Scrum:
-15 min mtg where team members communicate what work they've done, what problems they have, and what they plan to do. 
The also share solutions.
When a sprint is near closing a sprint retrospective mtg helps evaluate what went well and what needs 
to be fixed

OnTime software manages team and helps keep people on track

SCRUM MTG NOTES 9/29
Tasks this week:
- put together burndown chart starting 9/29 to end of semester to see hours needed (find projected velocity)

-use version control (GitHub) to organize and update notes (central repository of notes; include in backlog)
-anyway to keep other school work in burndown chart/backlog (count hours towards internship)
Note:
  include mts at Fairway in backlog (M/Th works best)

Mon Oct 27? Mtg at Fairway?

SCRUM MTG 10/20:
1. Notes on progress report:
  FLEXIBILITY:
    -numbers are not stiff
    -in traditional scrum
      -plan out spring
      -committing to delivery at end of sprint
    -No room for changes unless you want to completely stop the plan (not related to real-world scrum)
    
    -money is negotiable (re. when you actually get paid)
    
2. Misc notes:
-"Document management" instead of "notes"
-research Github, put notes in
-again, VERSION CONTROL

Answer "can the hours be met" by friday
